	<h1>Chad Woolley - Bio Blurb</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Hi, I'm Chad Woolley, AKA thewoolleyman everywhere. I've been a professional full-stack polyglot coder/sysadmin for 30+ years, from mainframes to cloud computing. I love loose coupling, high cohesion, and clean code. In many ways, technology is the easy part of software development and deployment - working with my fellow humans to build successful, empathetic, kind, and effective teams is also wonderfully fun and challenging! But I'll always be a coder, because that's what I love - I leave the management responsibilities to others.</p>
		<p>I've been a Software Engineer at GitLab since 2019. Prior to that, I've worked at Pivotal, IBM, Choice Hotels, and several other coding/sysadmin jobs. I graduated from New Mexico State in 1994 with a BBA in Business Computer Systems (because I didn't think I was good enough at math to get a CS degree). I originally learned to program by hacking BASIC on Apple II computers in the '80s (like <a href="https://youtu.be/I845O57ZSy4?t=436">John Carmack</a>)</p>
		<p>For more details on my skills and experience, you can see the resume which got me my current position at GitLab here: <a href="https://resume.thewoolleyweb.com">https://resume.thewoolleyweb.com</a>. It's an interactive, dynamic Single-Page App, deployed and hosted on GitLab. I created it to teach myself Vue.js and prove I knew enough to use it, which was a requirement for the full-stack position for which I was applying.</p>
		<p>I have an archaically outdated personal website at <a href="https://thewoolleyweb.com">https://thewoolleyweb.com</a> - all my contact info is at the bottom; feel free to connect with me. If you want to know what hacking I've been up to lately, ask me or check my recent activity on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/thewoolleyman">thewoolleyman</a>), or GitLab as <a href="https://gitlab.com/thewoolleyman">thewoolleyman</a> (personal) or <a href="https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab">cwoolley-gitlab</a> (work).</p>
