Re: Thank you for the InterviewDear Dellina, Sue, and Matt,

Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the position of Web Technology Coordinator.  I enjoyed talking with you, and you seem like a nice group of people to work with.  I am also excited about the unique opportunity to work for the Program in Integrative Medicine.  I feel that this would be a unique opportunity to have a job where I could be doing a "good thing" that I believe in, and have a direct role in making a positive impact on people's health and well-being.

I know that I am lacking experience in some of the areas you require, but I was honest when I said that I can learn and become proficient in new technologies very quickly.  However, as I said before, don't take my word for it - please contact my references and ask them (available from right button below).

I have created this page using Macromedia Flash MX as proof of my ability to quickly learn new skills.  It is a blatant copy of the tutorial sample, and contains little scripting.  Nonetheless, it is one day's work, and hopefully demonstrates my ability to quickly learn Flash and other skills required for this position.

Also, I would like to emphasize my feelings that this is a perfect position for me.  It would allow me to stay employed in Tucson, remain with my family, and allow my wife to return to U of A as a full time student.

Once again, it was a pleasure to meet you and I hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks for your time,
Chad
