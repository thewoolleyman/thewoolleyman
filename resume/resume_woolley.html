Hi, I'm Chad Woolley, AKA thewoolleyman everywhere.

I've been a professional full-stack polyglot coder/sysadmin for 25+ years, from mainframes to cloud computing.
I love loose coupling, high cohesion, pure functions, strong types, and dynamic languages.
But technology is the easy part of software development and deployment - working with
my fellow humans to build successful, empathatic, kind, and effective teams is much more
wonderfully challenging :)

I've been a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a> since 2006.

Prior to that, I've worked at IBM, Choice Hotels,  and several other coding/sysadmin jobs.
I graduated from New Mexico State in 1994 with a BBA in Business Computer Systems
(because I wasn't good enough at math to get a CS degree).

I'm not looking for a job, and I haven't updated my resume for over a decade (I want to rewrite it in PureScript someday),
but I have an archaically outdated website at
<a href="http://thewoolleyweb.com">http://thewoolleyweb.com</a> - all my contact info is at the bottom.

If you want to know what I've been up to lately, feel free to ask me or check my
<a href="http://github.com/thewoolleyman">GitHub</a>.

Thanks, and have a nice day.
